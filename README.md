# Animal Race Simulation

Welcome to the **Animal Race Simulation**! This Java program simulates an exciting race between different types of animals. The simulation includes various race types, animals with unique characteristics, and the use of threading to manage animal movements and race logic. The program is designed with a user-friendly graphical interface built using Java Swing.

## Features

- **Multiple Race Types**: Compete in different types of races, including regular and relay (courier) races.
- **Diverse Animal Types**: Choose from terrestrial, marine, and air animals with unique attributes and behaviors.
- **Thread Management**: Each animal is controlled by its own thread, ensuring realistic and independent movements during the race.
- **Animal Customization**: Customize each animal's characteristics, such as speed, energy, and special abilities, to gain an advantage in the race.
- **Race Control**: Start, stop, and monitor the progress of races directly from the main competition frame.
